Kitting Picking Lights

Arduino NANO



DONE:

> Arduino

> schematic

> Buttons



FOR HANDOFF:

> Implement barcodes with SLOCs (thru SAP, handoff bc I have no access)

> Make barcodes to scan?

> Wireless arduino/python?



Q's for JAX:

> Was the pick-to-light system created in MDT or contracted out?

> What did the integration of the system look like (placing lights, integration into inventory system, how long did it take, etc)

> Integration with SAP?

> Cost?

> Effectiveness?

> How does it work with multiple orders? With multiple pickers?

> Recommendations
